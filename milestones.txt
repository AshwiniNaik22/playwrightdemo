/**
 * Playwright E2E: Playlist creation flow
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file delivers BOTH requested objectives:
 * 1) Key milestones in the user journey (see below)
 * 2) Concrete test cases to ensure each milestone is crossed
 *
 * Assumptions (adapt as per app in Loom):
 * - App has email/password login.
 * - Data-test attributes exist (preferred) or replace selectors as needed.
 * - Base URL set in Playwright config.
 * - A searchable catalog of tracks exists.
 * - Duplicate track handling: app either prevents or allows with a toast; both paths covered.
 *
 * ---------------------------------
 * 1 KEY MILESTONES (USER JOURNEY)
 * ---------------------------------
 * M1: Auth gate passed (user can sign in and land on Library/Home)
 * M2: Create a new playlist (empty shell created and visible)
 * M3: Name/rename the playlist (title saved & persists)
 * M4: Add tracks to playlist (via search/browse; track chips/cards added)
 * M5: Save playlist (playlist stored and appears in list/sidebar)
 * M6: Verify playlist contents (correct track count/order)
 * M7: Basic playback sanity (first track can start playing)
 * M8: Persistence across reload/session (playlist & tracks remain after reload/new login)
 * M9: Edit operations (remove/reorder tracks) reflect correctly
 * M10: Guardrails (duplicates, empty save, invalid name) handled with proper UX
 *
